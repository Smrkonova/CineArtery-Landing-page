                    <p>Welcome to CineArtery, the professional networking platform designed specifically for film

                      individual. “Sensitive Personal Data” refers to categories of data that may require additional

                    <h3 id="2">2 Understanding What We Collect and Why</h3>
                    <h4>2.1 The Information You Share With Us and We collect</h4>
                    <p>Creating your professional presence on CineArtery starts with the basics. When you sign up, we
                      need your name, email address, mobile number, and a password to create your account. We also ask
                      you to specify whether you're joining as a producer (Production House, Pvt Company or
                      Organisation) Cast & Crew (like actor, director, technician) or another film professional( PR,
                      Rental, Marketing Person etc) since this helps us tailor the Platform to your specific needs. Your
                      location matters too, not just for legal compliance but because film production is inherently
                      location-based, and knowing where you're based helps connect you with relevant opportunities.
                      profile information (photograph, role, professional credits, last or working or Upcoming project,
                      CV/portfolio, Payment Terms/fees and other optional resume-style fields),</p>
                    <p>Your professional profile - The information you choose to share here transforms a basic account
                      into a powerful professional tool. This includes your stage name or professional name if different
                      from your legal name, your experience in the industry, photograph, role, professional credits,
                      last or working or Upcoming project, CV/portfolio, Payment Terms/fees and other optional
                      resume-style fields, languages you speak (crucial in India's multilingual film landscape), your
                      education and training, any union memberships, and the all-important portfolio materials like
                      headshots, showreels, and work samples, and other optional resume-style fields. For actors and
                      models, physical attributes like height may be relevant for certain roles, though sharing such
                      information is entirely your choice. You control what goes on your profile, and while a complete
                      profile increases your visibility and opportunities, we never require you to share anything you're
                      uncomfortable making professional public.</p>
                    <p>When you actively use the Platform, you generate additional information. Every message you send
                      to a potential collaborator, every project you apply to (budgets, scripts and similar files),
                      every document you upload for a production, and every schedule you coordinate through our calendar
                      features creates data that where applicable, billing or invoicing details required to process
                      payments. we process to provide these services. Think of it as the digital equivalent of the
                      paperwork, communications, and coordination that happens in any film production, just organized
                      and accessible in one place. We also collect technical and usage information automatically,
                      including IP address, device and browser information, operating system, device identifiers, log
                      data, crash reports and analytics data, and we use cookies and similar technologies to enable,
                      secure and improve the Service.</p>
                    <h4>2.2 Information From Your Interactions</h4>
                    <p>The Platform naturally observes how you use our services to make them work better for you. This
                      isn't about surveillance; it's about understanding patterns that help us improve. We notice which
                      features you use most, how long you spend reviewing different sections, what types of searches you
                      conduct, and where you might encounter difficulties. This usage data helps us identify which tools
                      are valuable and which need improvement. Your device and browser share technical information with
                      us automatically. This includes your IP address, the type of device you're using, your operating
                      system, browser type, and general location data, log data, crash reports and analytics data, and
                      we use cookies and similar technologies to enable, secure and improve the Service. We use this
                      primarily for security purposes and to ensure the Platform works properly on your specific setup.
                      If you grant permission, we can use more precise location data to show you opportunities in your
                      area or notify you about industry events nearby.</p>
                    <h4>2.3 How We Collect Data</h4>
                    <p>We collect data when you create or edit your account, upload or share content, communicate with
                      other Users or with our support team, subscribe to communications, make purchases or otherwise
                      interact with the Service. We may receive information about you from other Users when they view,
                      save or interact with your profile, and from third parties such as payment processors, identity
                      verification providers, background-check vendors and analytics providers. We also gather some
                      information automatically through server logs, cookies and similar technologies and from
                      integrations or connected services you choose to use.</p>
                    <h4>2.4 Information From Others</h4>
                    <p>We receive information when you're credited in projects, when others share your profile with
                      potential collaborators, or when you're included in group discussions about productions. We
                      occasionally work with third-party services to verify professional credentials or process
                      payments, and these partners share relevant information with us. For instance, if you connect your
                      social media accounts to import professional information, or if a payment processor confirms a
                      transaction, we receive this data to provide the requested service.</p>

                    <h3 id="3">3 Who Sees Your Information</h3>
                    <h4>3.1 Professional Visibility, Hiring and Inter-User Interactions on the Platform</h4>
                    <p>When you create a profile with us and set it to be discoverable, you're making a professional
                      choice to be visible to industry members who might offer opportunities. Producers, casting
                      directors, and production houses can view profiles based on their search criteria and professional
                      needs. They see the professional information you've chosen to share, can save profiles for future
                      reference, share them within their production teams for collective decision-making, and initiate
                      contact through our messaging system. This visibility is always under your control. You can adjust
                      your settings to be fully visible, visible only to certain types of users, temporarily hidden
                      while keeping your account active, or completely private. Remember though, limiting visibility
                      naturally limits opportunities. It's a balance you control based on your current professional
                      needs and comfort level. The Platform operates on mutual professional respect. While producers can
                      view your profile for hiring purposes, they cannot download your personal contact information in
                      bulk, use your information for purposes unrelated to professional film industry activities, or
                      share your information outside the Platform without your consent.</p>

                    <h3 id="4">4 Third-Party Service, Links and Integration</h3>
                    <h4>4.1 Service Providers</h4>
                    <p>Running a modern digital platform requires specialized services that we don't build ourselves. We
                      work with carefully selected partners who help us deliver our services effectively. Cloud
                      infrastructure providers store your data securely across multiple locations for reliability.
                      Payment processors handle financial transactions when you upgrade services or receive payments
                      through the Platform. Communication service providers help us deliver emails and SMS notifications
                      reliably. Analytics services help us understand how the Platform is used so we can improve it.
                      These partners access only the minimum information necessary to provide their specific services
                      and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements.</p>
                    <h4>4.2 Third-Party Links and Integrations</h4>
                    <p>The Service may include links to third-party websites, integrations with external cloud storage
                      or social login providers and embedded content. These third parties operate under their own
                      privacy policies and CineArtery is not responsible for their practices. If you choose to connect
                      or share data with third-party services, please review their privacy notices before doing so.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <h3 id="5">5 Your Rights and Controls</h3>
                    <h4>5.1 Accessing and Managing Your Data</h4>
                    <p>Indian data protection laws, particularly the evolving framework under the Digital Personal Data
                      Protection Act, recognize your fundamental rights over your personal information. Through your
                      account settings, you can view all the personal information we have about you, download your data
                      in a portable format, correct any inaccuracies, delete specific information, or close your account
                      entirely. These aren't just theoretical rights. We've built practical tools into the Platform to
                      exercise them. Your dashboard shows what information is visible to whom, your privacy settings
                      give granular control over visibility, and your data download feature provides a complete copy of
                      your information in a standard format you can review or transfer elsewhere.</p>
                    <h4>5.2 Withdrawing Consent</h4>
                    <p>You can withdraw consent for specific data uses at any time. If you no longer want to receive
                      promotional emails, you can unsubscribe immediately. If you don't want your profile visible to
                      producers, you can change that setting instantly. The withdrawal of consent doesn't affect the
                      lawfulness of processing that happened before you withdrew it, but it immediately changes how we
                      handle your data going forward. Some consent withdrawals affect functionality. If you withdraw
                      consent for us to process your professional profile, for instance, producers won't be able to
                      discover you for opportunities. We'll always explain these consequences clearly so you can make
                      informed decisions.</p>
                    <h4>5.3 Data Retention and Deletion</h4>
                    <p>We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes set out in this
                      Policy, to comply with legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to prevent fraud and abuse, and to
                      enforce our agreements. Active accounts retain data to maintain your professional history and
                      connections. After account closure, we generally delete personal data within sixty days, though
                      some information may be retained longer for legal compliance, such as financial records
                      Transactional and billing records will be retained in accordance with applicable tax, accounting
                      and regulatory obligations, or contracts and project documentation that have ongoing legal

                    <p>When payments are supported through the Service, we uses third-party payment processors to handle
                      payment card transactions and related data. Our current payment processor is Razorpay, which
                      maintains its own privacy and security practices and compliance obligations; We does not store
                      full payment card numbers on our servers except where explicitly disclosed and required, and we
                      rely on the payment processor’s secure handling of cardholder data. For details on Razorpay’s data
                      handling and security practices, including PCI-related obligations, please review Razorpay’s
                      documentation.</p>

                    <p>There are circumstances where we may need to share information without your explicit consent. If
                      we receive a valid court order or legal request from Indian authorities, we must comply with the
                      law. If we detect activity that threatens the safety of users or the public, we may need to act
                      quickly. If someone is violating our terms in ways that harm others, we might need to share
                      information to stop the harm. These situations are rare, and we always aim to notify affected
                      users unless legally prohibited from doing so.</p>

                    <p>We implement multiple layers of security to protect your data. Technical measures include
                      encryption for data in transit and at rest, secure authentication systems, regular security
                      updates and vulnerability assessments, and intrusion detection systems monitoring for threats.
                      Organizational measures include strict access controls ensuring only authorized personnel can
                      access data, include secure development practices, access controls, monitoring, encryption of data
                      in transit and, where practicable, encryption at rest and periodic security assessments. Despite
                      these measures, we must be honest that no online system is perfectly secure. We commit to promptly
                      notifying you of any breach that might affect your personal data, as required by law, and
                      continuously improving our security measures based on emerging threats and best practices. we

                    <p>While CineArtery primarily serves the Indian film industry, modern technology infrastructure
                      often involves international data flows. Your data may be transferred, processed and stored
                      outside India in jurisdictions where our service providers maintain infrastructure (cloud services
                      or Technology) for reliability and performance, engage specialized technical services. Such
                      transfers will be subject to appropriate safeguards and lawful mechanisms as required by
                      applicable law and, where required, we will rely on User consent and contractual protections to
                      permit such transfers. Users should understand that cross-border processing is sometimes necessary
                      to provide a global cloud-hosted Service and that reasonable safeguards will be used when data is
                      transferred internationally.</p>
